Web-app to figure out how 'Cloud-Ready' your application is.

With the widespread use of Cloud Computing in the world today, a question of whether existing applications can leverage the use of this technology arises. Apart from this, whether an application is particularly suited for the Cloud infrastructure or not is also a key question for technical managers and cloud administrators alike.

Hence, with Cloud-Ready we attempt to automate this decision making process as far as possible. The app takes in a number of parameters which are used for determining the Cloud model that would best suit the needs of the application to suggest a cloud provider that is a best fit. Apart from this, the web app also calculates a Cloud-Ready Score which tells you whether an application is actually fit for the Cloud.
